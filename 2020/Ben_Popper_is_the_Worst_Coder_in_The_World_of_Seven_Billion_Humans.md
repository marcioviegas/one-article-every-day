* One of the most fascinating lessons in the game is that you can write great code to optimize for size or speed, but you can’t necessarily find a solution that simultaneously optimizes for both.

* Before I started playing, I had assumed the ideal software would approach a sort of zen koan, something that packed the greatest possible productivity into the fewest number of characters, because simplicity is an essential virtue that builds on itself. 

* If I’ve invested 15 or 20 minutes into a level and cobbled together a set of instructions that get me 95% of the way to beating the mission, I will usually try and find a little glue to make the whole thing hold together long enough to work, rather than going back to square one and building something that avoids the structural mistakes.

* I was the same way as an English major in college. If I had written a 10 page paper and it just wasn’t gelling, I would try rearranging the order of the sections or adding better transitions, before admitting defeat and working on a new thesis. 

* The little bugs that don’t bother you when you have just a few hundred users start to create serious problems when you have tens of thousands. And unlike the levels in a video game, you don’t get a fresh start with every new rung on the ladder. Instead, you need to patch things up enough to keep them from breaking, accept that you’re adding to your technical debt, and keep on building.

* It’s not till you get in a real fight that you realize there is a big difference between philosophical notions and techniques trained on a willing opponent and what works in combat. Your body needs another thousand hours of practice, or even 10,000 hours, in order to actually put that to use in a situation where somebody isn’t helping you along.
