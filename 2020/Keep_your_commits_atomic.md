# [Keep your commits atomic](https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/)

* “What do I check in, and how often do I do it?” My answer is to make your changes as small and “atomic” as possible.

* An “atomic” change revolves around one task or one fix.

* The common thought with those new to source control is to commit “at the end of the work day”, or “whenever I feel like it”, or whenever a batch of fixes are complete. Avoid those pitfalls and consider what an “atomic” block of work is and make a commit only when that is complete. It may make your commit history more verbose, but in the end it will make your overall project a lot more flexible for bug fixes, feature migrations, and rollbacks.

* Commit each fix or task as a separate change

* Only commit when a block of work is complete

* Commit each layout change separately

* Joint commit for layout file, code behind file, and additional resources
