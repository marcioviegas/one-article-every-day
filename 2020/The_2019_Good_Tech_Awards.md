# [The 2019 Good Tech Awards](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/30/technology/the-2019-good-tech-awards.html)

* I’ll admit, handing out awards for good technology in 2019 feels a little like congratulating Godzilla for not destroying all of Tokyo.

* Polluted air is linked to one in eight deaths worldwide, and studies have shown that bad air quality can cause cognitive impairment in young people and increase the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease in the elderly. Christa Hasenkopf, an atmospheric scientist, decided to fix that. She and a software developer started OpenAQ, an open-source platform that collects air quality data from governments and international organizations in a single place and makes it free and accessible. 

* Few public health problems in the United States have proved as intractable as the opioid epidemic. But in 2019, three Massachusetts start-ups used technology to chip away at it.

* Goodr, described by its founder, Jasmine Crowe, as a “food delivery app in reverse,” is a platform based in Atlanta that helps save some of the 72 billion pounds of food wasted in the United States every year and give it to people in need.

* When you think of Pinterest, you probably picture mood boards, D.I.Y. hacks and mommy-bloggers. But the social network spent much of 2019 doing the kinds of tough, principled work that its bigger rivals often neglected. In August, the company announced that users searching for vaccine-related information would be shown results from authoritative sources like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, rather than being led down rabbit holes filled with misinformation. 

* In April, more than 4,200 Amazon employees sent an open letter to Jeff Bezos, the company’s chief executive, urging him to end the company’s contracts with oil and gas companies and commit to ambitious carbon-reduction goals. Amazon later announced a plan to become carbon neutral by 2040.

* Gypsy Guide, a simple, understated app that gives guided audio tours of national parks and other tourist destinations. The app uses your phone’s GPS to track your route through a park, and it narrates relevant facts as you drive past them.
