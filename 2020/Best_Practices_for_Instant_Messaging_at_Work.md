# [Best Practices for Instant Messaging at Work](https://hbr.org/2020/03/best-practices-for-instant-messaging-at-work)

* We’re still figuring out how to properly, and professionally, communicate via IM. These systems can create communication silos, where teams who are highly integrated in one platform are unable to collaborate with departments rooted in another.

* Rather than starting from scratch with a workplace IM system, companies should build upon what employees already know and like.

* But there are benefits to workers messaging about non-business topics, too. These digital interactions create camaraderie, and people are less likely to leave their jobs when they have friends at the office. Liking your colleagues has also shown to increase engagement by 700%.

* Instant messaging systems allows us to reach out to colleagues, reports, and bosses at any time — in a way that might seem more urgent than email. Unless the communication is extremely time-sensitive, resist this urge. Most messages can easily wait until the next business day.

* Explain to everyone that any requests made to colleagues should come with information about when answers are needed, and that most conversations should happen during the workday and kept short and to the point.

* Digital messages aren’t always easy to interpret. A boss who says, “I think you can do better” in person can be either motivational or discouraging, depending on whether the comment is delivered with a smile or disapproving glare, with outstretched hands or closed arms.
