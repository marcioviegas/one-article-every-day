Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology developed primarily by Kent Beck. XP was one of the first agile methods, indeed XP was the dominant agile method in the late 90s and early 00s before Scrum became dominant as the noughties passed. Many people (including myself) consider XP to be the primary catalyst that got attention to agile methods, and superior to Scrum as a base for starting out in agile development.

Kent describes XP by a progression of ideas from broad and abstract values through principles, to concrete practices - a progression that I find useful to apply in many other contexts. 

It popularized many practices that have since been widely used in software development, including: continuous integration, refactoring, TestDrivenDevelopment
