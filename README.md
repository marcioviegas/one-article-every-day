# OAED - One Article Every Day  

During an endless period of time, and once a day, I will be reading and aggregating in this repository, the articles that I noticed interesting. Those could be related to any subject. My only purpose here is to be continually reading new stuff and enjoy the journey while doing it. Please, join me.
