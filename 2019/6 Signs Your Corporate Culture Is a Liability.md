* "Just 28% of employees strongly agree that there is alignment between their company’s actions and its stated values"
* "So, how do organizations make the shift from reactive cultural clean-up to proactive cultural vigilance?"
* "Human resources and communications teams must partner to define a clear employee value proposition — the collection of programs and perks that answer the question “What’s in it for me?” — and then make it known and make it true."
* "Doubt about the company’s commitment to its values creeps in and the “See something, say something” mentality that defines collective cultural stewardship often falls by the wayside"
* "One of the few studies on why people leave the tech industry found that 40% of “tech leavers” indicated that unfairness or mistreatment such as stereotyping, harassment, and micro-aggressions played a major role in their decision to leave"
* "Executives are under intense pressure to deliver results and far too many are rewarded on what they achieve without factoring in how they achieved it.  According to our survey, almost one-third of employees say that their leaders don’t behave in ways consistent with company values"
* "Our research shows that company values – which should provide a north star for employee behavior – often don’t exist, aren’t known, or aren’t enabled by systems and processes.  One-third of employees whose companies have values don’t feel confident explaining them, and employees can’t live what they don’t know"
* "With a deep network of employee culture ambassadors, an annual global values week and ongoing values-driven internal communications, the company has been able to keep its shared beliefs top of mind"
* "Too often leaders develop their business strategy in a vacuum without being guided by core principles or considering whether organizational norms will support or stand in the way of their objectives"
