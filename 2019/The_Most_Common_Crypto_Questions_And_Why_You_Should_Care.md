# [The Most Common Crypto Questions And Why You Should Care](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2019/12/20/the-most-common-crypto-questions-and-why-you-should-care/\#39fc6bc8221e)

* Cryptocurrency consists of web-based digital assets that use cryptographic functions to conduct financial transactions. Digital assets typically utilize blockchain technology to gain transparency and decentralization to varying degrees. 

* An initial coin offering (ICO) is similar to an initial public offering (IPO) of stocks, but tokens are being offered rather than stocks in the ICO. The public exchanges money for tokens, which are an acknowledgment that the contract between buyer and issuer has been fulfilled. 

* Bitcoin, for example, is typically not defended as a security since it has no centralized governance and the price fluctuations are mostly from supply and demand, not tied to the success of a company or centralized organization.

* Bitcoin is a decentralized digital asset — arguably, the most popular — and typically takes up half of all digital asset trading volume on most given days. Bitcoin utilizes blockchain technology. Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency. It is the ledger that records all the cryptocurrency transactions that are verified by cryptography and is open, secure and accessible by all.

* Bitcoin will remain the asset of choice for those who want cryptocurrency that’s first-to-market, decentralized and determined by the people. The lack of governance, though scary to some, is exactly what appeals to others. 

* Space is not the final frontier, as cryptocurrency has created a new frontier. It is a combination of banking, currency trading and international commerce. In the increasingly global world of business, the ability to transfer funds securely and quickly around the world makes the need to explore this frontier all the more important.
