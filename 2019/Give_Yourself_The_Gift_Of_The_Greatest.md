# [Give Yourself The Gift Of The Greatest](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/12/17/give-yourself-the-gift-of-the-greatest-most-successful-decade-of-your-life/#7ad4af4c2fc2)

* Now, it's time for you to take care of yourself. Use this holiday season to give yourself a special gift—the permission to change your work-life for the better.

* We are our own worst enemies. We hold ourselves back by being too self-critical and deathly afraid of taking on new risks and challenges. It will soon be a new year and new decade. It's time for a radical change. Make this your decade to succeed. 

* When you ruminate over the excuses, they seem rational, but deep down inside you know that it's inertia. It's easier and less stressful to stay where you are. You think that the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t know.

* This new and upcoming decade is the perfect time to pursue a change. Stop telling yourself why you shouldn't do something and start demanding yourself to go after what you deserve. 

* Give yourself the gift of courage. No one else is going to do it for you. You must be the hero of your own story.

* Keep moving forward with determination and optimism. The laws of science say that an object in motion stays in motion. It's similar in life as your energy propels you forward and attracts people and opportunities to you. Conversely, if you stay still, nothing will ever change and you’ll always have regrets.

* Mistakes, poor decisions and bad luck make you doubt yourself and your abilities. You’re afraid to shoot for something new, as you feel you’ll just fail once again.

* Give yourself the gift of leaving the past in the past. Don't let the choices you’ve made over 10 years ago define who you are today. Start the new decade with a clean, fresh slate. Let go of past grudges and grievances. Make your inner peace with everyone around you. Carrying the heavy weight of hate, jealousy and anger wears you down. Shed this weight and start living the life you truly want and desire

* With all of the rancor in today’s society, it's easy to become jaded. Don't fall into that trap. Appreciate and give gratitude for everything that's good in your life. Tell your family, friends and colleagues how much you appreciate them. It will make them feel better and happier. It will make you feel good too.
