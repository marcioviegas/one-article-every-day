* “Twitter used to be a joke, like a fun thing for kids,” says Tauhid Zaman, an associate professor of operations management at Yale SOM. “Now it’s a national security issue.”

* Klausen provided a list of about 100 Twitter users known to be affiliated with ISIS. The team then identified those people’s followers, the people they followed, people connected to the followers, and so on, which yielded more than 1.3 million accounts

* Based on those measures, the researchers could automatically identify about 60% of accounts that were later suspended. About 10% of flagged users were false positives.

* Software that simply looked for similarities in names and photos worked fairly well. Suspended users often choose a similar screen name and image for their new account because they want previous followers to find them

* Using machine learning, the team assigned each such account a score, which captured the likelihood that a suspended user would re-follow them. The best approach, Zaman says, was to prioritize searching the networks of accounts with a high score and relatively few followers.
