# [The Evolution of Retail](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/evolution-retail-margaret-keane/)

* One that places people above product and experience ahead of expectations. This is not a retail apocalypse. This is a transformational journey. This is the evolution of retail.

* Millennials are driving social commerce, while Gen Z prefers to research online, but actually purchase in-store. And of course, GenX, Boomers and the Silent Generation have their own priorities and evolving preferences.

* Welcome to a new era where all generations have expectations of being able to customize the retail experience to meet their personal preferences.

* With a pop-up location, brands can test the appetite of consumers, experiment with store layout, learn quickly, and pivot. 

* Tthere will be consumers seeking products and brands seeking to deliver those products to them. This is not going away. So, while retail is in a state of rapid evolution and consumer preferences continue to evolve, there is no apocalypse, simply a revolution that will continue to set the stage for the next era of retail.
