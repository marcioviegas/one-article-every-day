# [What Kind of Chief Innovation Officer Does Your Company Need?](https://hbr.org/2019/11/what-kind-of-chief-innovation-officer-does-your-company-need)

* The job’s responsibilities vary a lot, depending upon the company, the business challenges, and the backgrounds of the people filling the roles. Those people include everyone from seasoned executives to one-time academics, star inventors, former investment bankers, creative heads, and founders of start-ups.

* They thrive in environments where innovation is as much about determining the right questions as it is about finding the answers.

* For investors, successful innovation involves carefully allocating resources in order to optimize selective opportunities. These executives are analytical, financially savvy, data focused, and driven

* Advocates, on the other hand, often start with big aspirations – specifically, the customer’s. They can be identified by their nonconforming clothing and a marketing or design-thinking background. 

* Out in the corporate wild, it’s common to see organizations getting in their own way when it comes to innovation. This is where motivators come in: They work to unleash the employees’ (and sometimes the customers’) creative spirit. That often involves getting the people and the culture focused on vision and imagination while reducing bureaucracy, complexity, and risk aversion. 

* Rather, they tend to be found in organizations that are trying to reinvent themselves. Motivators can skillfully shake up the organization by creating an inviting space for others to innovate within: putting in place the right incentives, organizational designs, and capabilities; and protecting the mavericks while encouraging the quiet voices to contribute

* Organizers are usually effective – but can also lose sight of the big picture. They need partners who understand customers to help them focus on the right issues – and motivators to help them see when risk taking should prevail.
