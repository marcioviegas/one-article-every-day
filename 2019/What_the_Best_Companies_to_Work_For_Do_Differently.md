# [What the “Best Companies to Work For” Do Differently](https://hbr.org/2019/12/what-the-best-companies-to-work-for-do-differently)


* The best places to work provide people with life satisfaction as opposed to job satisfaction alone. Almost all of the corporate founders and CEOs we spoke with told us that they built their companies with people in mind. To them, a healthy culture is as important as a healthy balance sheet. Their benefits go far beyond minimum wage

* This is what happens when companies invest in people. The generations prosper

* “Profit is necessary, but it is not the goal. We need air and water to survive, but that isn’t our purpose. Our purpose is to help people live better lives.”

* The companies we studied find ways to rejuvenate employees by helping them identify their “calling,” or the area of work that provides them with the greatest fulfillment.

* The methods companies used to accomplish this generally differed, but all the organizations we spoke with provided workers with opportunities to pursue their passions

* This purity of position makes a big difference to people who work there because they feel a genuine sense of purpose

* The organizations we interviewed realized that their effectiveness relies upon the goodwill and solidarity of groups, so they put quite a bit of effort into bringing people together — but not in the traditional ways you might think.

* The best companies realize that personal affinities and deep social bonds are failsafe measures against team breakdowns and are essential for top team performance.

* Employees who have the leeway to rearrange, modify, and improve their assignments feel possession over them, and once this happens, their mindsets begin to change. Instead of focusing on what cannot be done, they become preoccupied with what can. As a result, they are more easily able to grow, innovate, and push their companies forward.

* We all feel a great sense of responsibility not just to our clients, but to one another

* Tom Caporaso, the CEO of Clarus Commerce, runs his company in a similar manner. From start to finish, his philosophy resembles that of a winning sports team: hire good people; train, practice, and prepare; coach teammates to back each other up, learn from their mistakes, and accept wins and losses together; get off the field and let the players, play. 

* Of course, letting people work within their capabilities, and a little beyond them, also means managers must accept that people will occasionally fail. 

* These companies showed us that the ability to be authentic at your job is life-affirming: an outward expression of who we are and what we stand for

* Given our findings, it is safe to say that, today, too many businesses function with only their own interests in mind. If the presumption is that capable, profit-making management should put money before people, then our vision is terribly flawed. These flaws are due not necessarily to a failed exegesis of how markets work, but to gross misconceptions of how people work. The organizations we studied have given themselves the best chance to succeed by recognizing the human as the heart of the workplace, the thing that keeps everything else running.

* When we ask leaders merely to perform their duties and to be an instrument within a money-making apparatus, we are asking them to do far too little and giving them an opportunity to avoid asking tough questions about what is most important in life. It is a mistake to let leaders escape the civic responsibilities we have toward one another due to an erroneous belief that, through agnostic business dealings, the good life will trickle down. We can be much more direct by insisting that leaders foster human potential and support human flourishing as obligations of their roles. If we do not have any deeper aims for business, then for whom and for what do we go through all this trouble?
