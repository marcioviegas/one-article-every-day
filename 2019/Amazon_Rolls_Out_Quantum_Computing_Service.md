# [Amazon Rolls Out Quantum-Computing Service](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-rolls-out-quantum-computing-service-11575314729)

* Amazon. com Inc.’s cloud-services division is offering select enterprise customers the ability to experiment with early-stage quantum-computing services over the cloud, following other companies racing to commercialize the emerging technology.

* Microsoft and IBM are also allowing companies to experiment with quantum-computing hardware over their respective clouds. Amazon and Microsoft dominate in cloud computing. Together, the companies held 60% of the cloud market last year.

* Quantum computing could also be useful for transportation and logistics companies, including Amazon, said Bill Vass, vice president of technology at AWS. The technology could help find more efficient routes to get deliveries from one place to another while avoiding traffic, all in near real-time, he said.

* While traditional computers store information as either zeros or ones, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which represent and store information as both zeros and ones simultaneously.

* Google in October announced a quantum-computing experiment that generated about 1 million random strings of numbers in roughly three minutes, a task the company said would have taken the world’s fastest conventional supercomputer 10,000 years—though scientists at IBM disagreed, saying the task could be handled by a traditional computer in 2½ days.

* While new innovations in quantum computing are happening daily, it is hard to predict when a commercial-grade quantum computer will be built that can add real business value, said Simone Severini, director of quantum computing at AWS.
