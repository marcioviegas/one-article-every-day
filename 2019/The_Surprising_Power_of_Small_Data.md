* Chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes have been on the rise for decades. They’re the number one cause of death and disability in the U.S. today and one reason why health care costs are out of control.

* Several studies have found that such programs can end up costing more money than they save. One likely reason, he says, is that the risk assessments themselves aren’t all that accurate.

* “If you wrongly identify someone as high risk — a so-called ‘false positive’ — you pay for unnecessary services,” Bayati says. “And if you miss someone who truly is at risk — a false negative — then you still get hit with those huge medical bills in the future.”

* One solution, he says, would be to run a more elaborate panel of tests. But that would also increase cost. “Lab tests are expensive. Companies are doing this for lots of employees, so they look at a fairly small set of standard biomarkers. And then the detection ability isn’t very strong.’

* “You have to wonder. In every industry, companies are investing resources to gather more and more data. We’re putting sensors on everything just because we can, and frankly, it isn’t all necessary or useful.”

* The fundamental question is, if you have too much information, how can you narrow it down to the most useful smaller set of information? How do you reduce the dimensions of the data set?”

* What’s crucial, Bayati says, is to be clear on the objectives. Computers can do the analysis, but humans have to tell them what to optimize.

* And that’s a step, he thinks, companies too often gloss over. “Sometimes it seems that firms are just rushing to accumulate data and asking questions later. But more information isn’t necessarily better. What matters is knowing what to look at. Our paper is a step in that direction.”
