# [Controlling attention with brain waves](http://news.mit.edu/2019/controlling-attention-brain-waves-1204)

* People can enhance their attention by controlling their own alpha brain waves based on neurofeedback they receive as they perform a particular task.

* The study found that when subjects learned to suppress alpha waves in one hemisphere of their parietal cortex, they were able to pay better attention to objects that appeared on the opposite side of their visual field. 

* There are billions of neurons in the brain, and their combined electrical signals generate oscillations known as brain waves. Alpha waves, which oscillate in the frequency of 8 to 12 hertz, are believed to play a role in filtering out distracting sensory information.

* However, it was unclear if alpha waves control attention or are just a byproduct of some other process that governs attention

* It would be interesting to understand how long-lasting these effects are, and whether you can use them therapeutically, because there’s some evidence that alpha oscillations are different in people who have attention deficits and hyperactivity disorders
